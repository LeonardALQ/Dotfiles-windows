# Firefox-CSS
Very minimalistic setup. 

The side bar is [Tab Center Reborn](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tabcenter-reborn/) with custom CSS. 

The toolbar is only accessible via keyboard, by default it is `CTRL + L` 

NOTE: Both `userChrome.css` and `tabCenterReborn.css` should be minified before applied to reduce load time.
